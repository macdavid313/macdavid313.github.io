In a project course, every student was invited to give a presentation about what kind of tool or language been used for the project as the course’s first discussion session. This keynote is thus the one (but not the original one) I’d used to give a brief introduction about Common Lisp, which is used to build a simple academic paper recommendation system for the course.</description></item></channel></rss>

An essential part of the reason why I choose Lisp in this case is, CLOS, one of the most powerful tools for designing complicated concepts. It’s a nice experience using CLOS to successfully solve some hard problems along with extending some components.
However, the embarrassing thing is I’ve never delivered a web application before, all I know is developing, debugging within SLIME and writing some scripts to deliver a binary executable so far.</description></item></channel></rss>
